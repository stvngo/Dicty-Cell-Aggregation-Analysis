# Simple LAP Tracker

This tracker is identical to the sparse LAP tracker present in this trackmate, except that it proposes fewer tuning options. Namely, only gap closing is allowed, based solely on a distance and time condition. Track splitting and merging are not allowed, resulting in having non-branching tracks.
